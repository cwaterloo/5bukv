The bot helps to guess English five\-letter words in Wordle game\.

*How to guess words*

The process of guessing words is built on interactive sessions\. A session consists of a series of moves\.
Send /start to the bot in order to start a new session\.

Each move begins with a bot turn\. The bot gives the user a guess and starts waiting for them to enter a response\.
Each letter of the guessed word receives a corresponding button\. The buttons are arranged by the bot in order to
receive user response\. The caption of each button consists of two parts\.

 \* Evaluation sign: \+, − or \= \(see below\)

 \* The corresponding letter itself

The \+ sign means that the letter is present in the hidden word, but is in the wrong place\.

The − sign means that the hidden word has no such letter\.

The \= sign means that the letter is present in the hidden word and is in the right place\.

Pressing the buttons changes the states in loop: −, \+, \=\. Now it’s your turn to transfer
the letters one by one to the desired state\. Press _Forward_ button to start the next move\.
Once it’s pressed the one of the following three conditions occurs\.

 \* The bot makes a new turn\. The scenario described above starts over\.

 \* The bot reports that there are no suitable words\.

 \* The bot reports that the word has been successfully guessed and shows it\.

 At any step, you can press _Back_ button to go back along the chain and correct something\.

 *Implementation details*

 Sometimes the entered letter states might be changed if, for example, the user presses _Forward_ button first
 and then immediately presses _Back_ button\. It happens when at least one letter occurs multiple times in the
 guessed word\. If the repeated letter is marked with \+ or \= sign in one place and with − sign in another,
 all the occurrences marked with − sign will be marked with \+ sign instead\. This allows the bot to not rely
 so much on the words that have repeated letters\.

 Guessing words is based on vocabulary\. The bot *cannot successfully guess a word* if it is not a part of the
 vocabulary\. And vice versa, the bot is useless if *its guess is not acceptable*\.

 *See chain length statistics below* \(format: attempt count/word count\)\.
