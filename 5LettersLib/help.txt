The bot helps to guess English five\-letter words in Wordly game\.

*How to guess words*

The process of guessing words is built on interactive sessions\. A session consists of a series of moves\.
Send /start to the bot in order to start a new session\.

Each move begins with a bot turn\. The bot gives the user a guess and starts waiting for them to enter a response\.
Each letter of the guessed word receives a corresponding button\. The buttons are arranged by the bot in order to
receive user response\. The background color of each button corresponds the state of its letter\.

Blue color means that the letter is present in the hidden word, but is in the wrong place\.

Red color means that the hidden word has no such letter\.

Green color means that the letter is present in the hidden word and is in the right place\.

Pressing the buttons changes the states in loop: red, blue, green\. Now it’s your turn to transfer
the letters one by one to the desired state\. Press _Forward_ button to start the next move\.
Once it’s pressed the one of the following three conditions occurs\.

 \* The bot makes a new turn\. The scenario described above starts over\.

 \* The bot reports that there are no suitable words\.

 \* The bot reports that the word has been successfully guessed and shows it\.

 At any step, you can press _Back_ button to go back along the chain and correct something\.

 *Implementation details*

 Guessing words is based on vocabulary\. The bot *cannot successfully guess a word* if it is not a part of the
 vocabulary\. And vice versa, the bot is useless if *its guess is not acceptable*\.

 *See chain length statistics below* \(format: attempt count/word count\)\.
